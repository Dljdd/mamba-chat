# Mamba-Chat üêç

Mamba-Chat is the first chat language model based on a state-space model architecture, not a transformer.

The model is based on Albert Gu's and Tri Dao's work *Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces* as well as their [model implementation](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba). This repository provides training / fine-tuning code for the model based on some modifications of the Huggingface Trainer.
